Modifying the configuration
---------------------------

The buildbot configuration file is hosted in a Git repository. To clone the
repository, 

    $ git clone ssh://buildbot@build.cmi.kent.edu/fipy-buildbot.git

This should create a directory called `fipy-buildbot`.

    $ cd fipy-buildbot/
    $ ls
    buildbot.tac  master.cfg  public_html/

Edit `master.cfg` as needed.

    $ $EDITOR master.cfg

If possible, check the configuration locally.

    $ buildbot checkconfig

Push the updated config back to the repository.

    $ git add master.cfg
    $ git commit -m 'fixed flux capacitor'
    $ git push origin master

Buildbot will automatically reconfigure when the push is received.

If the Buildbot website is down after pushing, that probably means that your
change introduced an error into the config file. To debug, ssh into the build
machine and check the log files.

    $ ssh obeirne@build.cmi.kent.edu
    obeirne@buildbot-test$ cd /srv/buildbot/fipy-buildbot
    obeirne@buildbot-test$ less twistd.log

-------------------
Adding a buildslave
-------------------

Choose a name and a password for the new buildslave. Modify `master.cfg` as per
the instructions above (on any machine) to recognize the new buildslave by
adding a new element to the `c['slaves']` list like so:

    c['slaves'] = [
                   ..., # existing slaves
                   BuildSlave('newSlaveName', 'newSlavePasswd'),
                  ]

Push `master.cfg` and make sure buildbot reconfigures successfully.
    
    $ git add master.cfg
    $ git commit -m "added buildslave 'newSlaveName'"
    $ git push origin master

Ensure that the buildslave can communicate on port 9989. This may entail
forwarding ports on the buildslave's router. The buildslave will receive
commands over this port from the master to begin a build and will relay results
to the master over the same port.

Ensure that `buildslave` is installed on the slave.

    slave$ buildslave --version

If not, get it.

    slave$ easy_install buildbot-slave

Then, set up the buildslave with all of FiPy's dependencies.

Ask `buildslave` to create the slave.

    slave$ buildslave create-slave [newDir] build.cmi.kent.edu:9989 \
                                   [slaveName] [slavePasswd]
                                   
Modify admin and host information.

    slave$ uname -a > newDir/info/host
    slave$ $EDITOR newDir/info/admin
    slave$ $EDITOR newDir/info/host

Start the slave.

    slave$ cd newDir
    slave$ buildslave start

Add buildslave command to the crontab

    slave$ crontab -e
    # m  h dom mon dow command
    */10 * *   *   *   cd .../newDir ; buildslave start > /dev/null 2>&1 &

---------------
Adding a branch
---------------

Modify `master.cfg` to include the name of the branch in the `branches` list at
the top of the file like so:

    branches = [
                'trunk',
                ...,
                'branches/newBranch',
               ]

Push `master.cfg` and ensure that buildbot reconfigured correctly by checking
the website.
