CVS usage

Most users will not want to download the latest state of |FiPy| in the CVS
repository, as these files are subject to active development and may not
behave as desired. Any released version of |FiPy| will be designated with
a fixed tag:

``version-x_y``
    designates a released version x.y

    The current version of |FiPy| is |VERSION|.

Most users will not be interested in particular version numbers, but
instead with the degree of code stability.  Different "tracking tags" are
used to indicate different stages of |FiPy| development.  You will need to
decide on your own risk tolerance when deciding which stage of development
to track.  The tracking tags applied |FiPy|, in decreasing order
stability, are:

``STABLE``
    designates the most recent release in the repository that can be
    considered stable for daily use by the common user.  This is a good tag
    to track if you don't want to run into bugs introduced with ongoing
    development but would like to take advantage of new features as soon as
    possible.

``CURRENT``
    designates the most recent code on the trunk forming a coherent state
    of |FiPy|, in general this will mean a release, but can also mean a
    pre-release testing version.  For instance, the release engineer might
    ask testers to test ``CURRENT`` before he makes a release.

``HEAD``
    this is a CVS internal tag designating the latest revision of any file
    present in the repository.  It is also a valid branch tag designating
    the trunk.  For our purposes ``HEAD`` can be used as a tracking tag
    designating the very latest code checked into the repository; |FiPy| is
    not guaranteed to pass its tests or to be in a consistent state when
    checked out under this tag.  This tracking tag is restricted to the
    trunk.

One final type of tracking tag to note:

``branch-version-x_y``
    designates a line of development based on a previously released version
    (i.e., if current development work is being spent on version 0.2, but a
    bug is found and fixed in version 0.1, that fix will be tagged as
    ``version-0_1_1``, and can be obtained from ``branch-version-0_1``).

..

Any other tags will not generally by of interest to most users.


A fresh copy of |FiPy| that is designated by a particular ``<tag>`` can be
obtained with::

   $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fipy \
   >     checkout -r <tag> fipy

An existing CVS checkout of |FiPy| can be shifted to a different state of
development by issuing the command::

   $ cvs update -r <tag>
