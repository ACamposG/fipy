`Jon Guyer`_ 
    is a member of the research staff of the `Metallurgy Division`_ in
    |MSEL| at |NIST|.  Jon's computational interests are in object-oriented
    design and in phase field modeling of electrochemistry.

`Daniel Wheeler`_ 
    is a caveman.  Daniel's interests are in numerical modeling, finite
    volume techniques, and level set treatments.

`Jim Warren`_ 
    is a member of the research staff of the `Metallurgy Division`_ and the
    Director of |CTCMS| of |MSEL| at |NIST|.  Jim is responsible for the
    oversight and management of |FiPy|.  Jim is interested in a variety of
    problems, including the phase field modeling of solidification,
    polycrystalline solids, and the electrochemical interface.

Alex Mont
    is a student at `Montgomery Blair High School`_.  Alex developed the
    `PyxViewer` and the `Gmsh` import and export modules.
