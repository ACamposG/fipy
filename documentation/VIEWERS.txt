Matplotlib

http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

:term:`Matplotlib` is a Python_ package that displays publication quality
results. It displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for
structured data. It does not display unstructured 2D data or 3D data.
It works on all common platforms and produces publication quality hard
copies. Version 0.72.1 or higher is required. `Matplotlib installers
for specific platforms`_ are available 
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80706&package_id=82474>.

.. note::

   :term:`Matplotlib` is noticeably slower than :term:`Pygist` or Gnuplot.py_, but
   has superior image rendering and plotting functionality.

Mayavi
======

http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/

The `Mayavi 2`_ Data Visualizer is a free, easy to use scientific data
visualizer.  It displays 1D, 2D and 3D data. It is the only :term:`FiPy`
viewer available for 3D data. Other viewers are probably better for 1D
or 2D viewing. 

.. note::
   
   `Mayavi 2`_ is packaged for Ubuntu and Debian linux. Using the packaged versions makes installation much easier.

.. note::

   MayaVi 1 is no longer supported.

These packages receive little or no support, but are still compatible
with :term:`FiPy`.

Pygist ======

http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/software/gist/

The :term:`Pygist` package can be used to display simulation results. It
displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for both
structured and unstructured data. It does not display 3D
data. Although stated as working on Windows, it does not seem to do a
good job of rendering on this platform. :term:`Pygist` works fine on other
common platforms. :term:`Pygist` no longer seems to be under development, but
is still recommended as a fast light weight alternative to
:term:`Matplotlib`.

.. attention::

   :term:`Pygist` requires the old Numeric module to be installed.

.. warning:: 

   The facility to produce hard copies in :term:`Pygist` does not work very well and
   may crash the :term:`FiPy` run. "``.eps``" and "``.cgm``" export seem to work.

.. note::

   If you experience difficulty building the native :term:`Pygist` viewer on
   `Mac OS X`_, you may wish to build the package with the :option:`--x11`
   option described in its documentation.

.. note::

   :term:`Pygist` can have problems finding color pallets, such as "``heat.gp``" and 
   "``work.gs``", when installed locally. You may need to set the 
   :envvar:`GISTPATH` environment variable to point to the directory containing 
   these files (you may find it as "``g/``" within the directory you 
   specified for :option:`--home`).

Gnuplot-py
==========

http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net

Gnuplot.py_ is a Python_ package that interfaces to :term:`gnuplot`, the
popular open-source plotting program. It displays both 1D X-Y type
plots and 2D contour plots for structured data but not for
unstructured data or 3D data. It works on all common platforms and
produces hard copies, however, it sometimes breaks on Windows. As a
general remark, the viewing quality using either :term:`Pygist` or
:term:`Matplotlib` is preferable.
