\chapter{Numerical Methods}

This chapter describes the numerical methods used to solve equations
in the \FiPy{} programming environment. FiPy{} uses the Finite Volume
Method (FVM) to solve coupled sets of Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs).

Essentially, the FVM consists of dividing the solution domain into
discrete finite volumes over which the state variables are
approximated with linear or higher order interpolations. The
interpolations are satisfied with simple approximations to the
derivatives in each term of the equation. This process is known as
discretization. The (FVM) is a popular discretization technique
employed to solve coupled PDEs used in many application areas
(e.g. Fluid Dynamics).
