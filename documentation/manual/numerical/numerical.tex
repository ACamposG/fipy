\chapter{Finite Volume Method}

This chapter descvribes the way \FiPy{} solves equations.

Essentially, the solution domain is divided into discrete finite
volumes over which the state variables are approximated with linear or
higher order interpolations. This process is known as discretization.
A common discretization technique is the Finite Volume Method (FVM)
where the variable interpolation is satisfied with simple
approximations to the derivatives in each term of the equation.
