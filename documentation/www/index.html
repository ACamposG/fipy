FiPy: A Finite Volume PDE Solver Using Python 
</p>

</div>

<!-- Page Content Begin -->

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>
FiPy is an object oriented partial differential equation (PDE)
solver written in Python based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach.
The solution of coupled sets of PDEs is ubiquitous in the numerical
simulation of science problems. Numerous PDE solvers exist using a variety
of languages and numerical approaches. Many are proprietary, expensive and
difficult to customize. As a result, scientists spend considerable
resources repeatedly developing limited tools for specific problems. Our
approach, combining the FV method and Python, provides a tool that is
extensible, powerful and freely available. A significant advantage to
Python is the existing suite of tools for array calculations, sparse
matrices and data representation. The FiPy framework includes terms for
transient diffusion, convection and standard sources, enabling the solution
of arbitrary combinations of coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic
PDEs. Current models include phase field treatments of electrochemical,
polycrystalline and dendritic phase transformations as well as a level set
treatment of the electrodeposition process.
</p>

<h2>Aims</h2>



<p>
The goal of the FiPy framework is to develop a highly customizable open
source code available to the scientific community. FiPy allows users to
select and customize modules from within the framework. Those modules can
then be combined with an extremely powerful high level scripting language
allowing the user full control over the solution algorithm. This ’top down’
method of computer programming allows significant code reuse while
accounting for the unique vagaries of each problem. The initial development
of the framework has been undertaken in the Center for Theoretical and
Computational Materials Science (CTCMS), in the Materials Science and
Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). The framework is known as FiPy and is developed at the
top level in the Python programming language. Python enables the
integration of low-level high performance languages such as C and FORTRAN
allowing for efficient optimization. Python also has a large repository of
free numerical and scientific software that can be integrated into the FiPy
framework. At NIST, there is a significant ongoing effort to maximize the
efficiency of FiPy with the use of third party software and the judicious
use of the C programming language embedded in standard core modules. The
end goal of FiPy is to provide a realistic open source choice for solving
coupled sets of equations. Once an efficient customizable framework is
developed, the end goal will only be achieved with proper support for the
community of users. Many previous scientific computing projects, although
valuable tools, are not adopted by the end users due to inadequate
distribution tools and lack of support. Adequate support consists of clear
documentation, efficient distribution methods, a code repository, regular
code updates (bug fixes) and a test infrastructure. We aim to address all
of these issues. The aims mentioned above can be summarized as follows: 
</p>

<UL>
    <LI>Develop core test piece models for various material science problems.
    <LI>Develop a highly efficient and customizable code. 
    <LI>Support the distribution of code to the end users.
</UL
