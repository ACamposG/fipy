 Installation
=====================================

Operating System
================

The only elements of |FiPy| that may be platform-dependent are the viewers. 
All other aspects should function on any platform that has a Python_
installation.

|FiPy| has been developed and tested on `Mac OS X`_ 10.3 [*]_ and higher and
on ???  runing RedHat Linux blah blah.  

.. _Mac OS X: http://www.apple.com/macosx/

..  [*] Certain commercial products are identified here to foster
    understanding.  Such identification does not imply recommendation or
    endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor
    does it imply that the products identified are necessarily the best
    available for the purpose.

Required Packages
=================

Python
------

|FiPy| is built with the Python_ language and requires a Python_
installation to run. Python_ comes pre-installed on many operating systems,
which you can check by opening a terminal and typing ``python``, *e.g.*::

    [dogbert:~] guyer% python
    Python 2.3 (#1, Sep 13 2003, 00:49:11) 
    [GCC 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1495)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

If necessary, you can download_ and install it for your platform.  |FiPy|
requires at least version 2.1 of Python_, but version 2.3 or newer is
recommended.

.. _Python:   http://www.python.org/
.. _download: http://www.python.org/download/

Numeric
-------

Obtain and install the Numeric_ package.  |FiPy| has been tested with
version 23.1 of Numeric_.  The newer Numarray_ package is not supported at
this time.

.. _Numeric:  http://www.numpy.org
.. _Numarray: http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray

weave
-----

Significantly improved performance has been achieved with the judicious use
of C language inlining, via the weave_ module of the SciPy_ package.

.. _SciPy: http://ww.scipy.org/

Recommended Packages
====================

One or more of the following packages is required to view results.

Pygist
------

The Pygist_ package can be used to display simulation results. We have not 
succeeded in building the native Pygist_ viewer on `Mac OS X`_ and
recommend building the package with the ``--x11`` option described in the
documentation.

.. _Pygist: http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/python/pygist.html

PyX
---

PyX_ allows the production of publication quality graphics with |TeX|
labels.

.. _PyX: http://pyx.sourceforge.net/


Obtaining |FiPy|
================

The source for |FiPy| can be obtained via CVS::

    ssh_agent
    ssh_add
    CVSROOT=dromio.nist.gov:/users/wd15/pkg/python/repository
    export CVSROOT
    CVS_RSH=ssh
    export CVS_RSH
    cvs checkout fipy

|FiPy| uses a customized version of Roman Geus'_ spmatrix_ package.  Due to
a peculiar bug in its ``setup.py`` script, ``python setup.py install`` may
not work correctly on the first execution, but will generate an error
regarding ``/usr/bin/ld: undefined symbols``.  If you receive this error,
copy the preceding command beginning with ``gcc`` (it can be several lines)
and paste it at the command-line to re-execute it.  Then execute ``python
setup.py install`` again.  You will need to repeat this sequence four
times.
