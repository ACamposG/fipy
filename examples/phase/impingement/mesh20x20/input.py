r"""
We initialize the system by running the base script
    
    >>> import examples.phase.impingement.mesh20x20.base
    >>> exec(examples.phase.impingement.mesh20x20.base.script())
    
We iterate the solution in time, plotting as we go if running interactively,

    >>> for i in range(steps):
    ...     it.timestep(dt = timeStepDuration)
    ...     if __name__ == '__main__':
    ...         phaseViewer.plot()
    ... 	thetaProductViewer.plot()

The solution is compared against Ryo Kobayashi's test data

    >>> theta.allclose(testData, rtol = 1e-10, atol = 1e-10)
