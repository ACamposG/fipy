===========================
Simple Windows Installation
===========================

These instructions are simple step by step instructions for the
`Windows XP`_ and `Windows 2000`_ platforms. Please see the more
general |INSTALLATION-txt| for detailed installation instructions.
These step by step instructions are not the only way to
set up |FiPy| on a Windows OS but represent the most expedient way
from our experience to have a usable installation up and running.

.. note

    The first five steps require downloading installation .exe binary
    files from various websites. When given the choice to run (open)
    or save these files it is best to simply chooose run (open).

----------------------
Step 1: Install Python
----------------------

Download and run the `Enthough Edition`_ installer.

---------------------
Step 2: Install PyVTK
---------------------

Download and run the `PyVtk`_ installer.

------------------------
Step 3: Install Pysparse   
------------------------

Download and run the `PySparse`_ installer.

--------------------
Step 4: Install FiPy
--------------------

Download and run the `|FiPy|`_ installer

     - add in test.gz files.
     - stop mayavi printing stuff at each step

----------------------
Step 6: Install Matplotlib
----------------------

Download and run the `PyGist` installer

--------------------
Step 5: Install Gmsh
--------------------

Download and unpack `Gmsh for Windows`_. Open the unpacked file with a
file browser and copy the gmsh and cygwin1.dll to C:\Python23.

-----------------
Step 6: Run IDLE_
-----------------

The IDLE_ environemnet is recomended for running |FiPy|. In order to have
interactive viewing capabilities the -n option is required. To run IDLE_ on
with the -n option follow the following instructions:

   - Click on "Start"
   - Click on "Programs"
   - Click on "Python 2.3 (Enthought Edition)"
   - Right click on "IDLE (Python GUI)" and click on "Create Shortcut" which creates "IDLE (Python GUI)(2)"
   - Right click on "IDLE (Python GUI)(2)"
   - Click on properties
   - Add the -n option to "Target" being sure to leave a space after the last quote and before -n
   - Drag and drop "IDLE (Python GUI)(2)" to the desktop to create an icon.

--------------------------------------------
Step 7: Import a module and view the results
--------------------------------------------

You can use the IDLE_ path browser to find FiPy examples. For example to run
the 2D diffusoin example,

    - Click on "File"
    - Click on "Path Browser"
    - Click on "C:\Python23\lib\site-packages"
    - Click on "examples"
    - Click on "diffusion"
    - Click on "steadyState"
    - Click on "mesh50x50"
    - Click on "input.py"

This will open an editor simple press the F5 key to run the example.
A matplotlib viewer should appear with a rainbow stripes.

Another way to use FiPy examples is to import the example file and then run any functionality
it ma have. For example at the IDLE command line run the following code:

    >>> from examples.levelSet.electroChem.inputGold import runGold.
    >>> runGold(numberOfSteps = 100)

A MayaVi viewer should appear with a trench filling simulation.
