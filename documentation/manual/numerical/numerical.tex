This chapter describes the numerical methods used to solve equations
in the \FiPy{} programming environment. \FiPy{} uses the Finite Volume
Method (FVM) to solve coupled sets of Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). For a good introduction to the FVM see
\href{http://www.gre.ac.uk/~ct02/research/thesis/main.html}{Nick
Croft's PHD online}, Patanker~\cite{patanker} or Versteek and
Malalasekera~\cite{versteeg_malalasekera}.

Essentially, the FVM consists of dividing the solution domain into
discrete finite volumes over which the state variables are
approximated with linear or higher order interpolations. The
derivatives in each term of the equation are satisfied with simple
approximate interpolations in a process known as discretization. The
(FVM) is a popular discretization technique employed to solve coupled
PDEs used in many application areas (e.g. Fluid Dynamics).
