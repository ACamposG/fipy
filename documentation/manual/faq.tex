    \item[How do I represent an equation in \FiPy{}?]  
    
    As explained in Chapter~\ref{chap:Numerics}, the canonical
    governing equation that can be solved by \FiPy{} for the dependent
    \Class{CellVariable} $\phi$ is
        \begin{equation}                        
             \underbrace{
               \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t}
             }_{\text{transient}}
             =
             \underbrace{
               \vphantom{\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t}}
               \nabla \cdot \left( \vec{u} \phi \right)
             }_{\text{convection}}
             +
             \underbrace{
               \vphantom{\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t}}
               \left[ \nabla \cdot \left( \Gamma_i \nabla \right) \right]^n \phi
             }_{\text{diffusion}}
             +
             \underbrace{
               \vphantom{\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t}}
               S_{\phi}
             }_{\text{source}}
             \tag{\ref{eqn:num:gen}}
        \end{equation}
        A physical problem can involve many different coupled
        governing equations, one for each variable.  Numerous specific
        examples are presented in Part~\ref{part:Examples}, but let us
        examine this general expression term-by-term:

            \begin{reSTadmonition}[Note]
                As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:NumericalSchemes}, the
                convection schemes need to calculate a P\'eclet number,
                and therefore need to know about any diffusion term
                used in the problem.  It is hoped that this dependency
                can be automated in the future.

            \item[How do I represent a source term $S_{\phi}$?]
            Any term that cannot be written in one of the previous
            forms is considered a source.  An explicit source is
            written in Python essentially as it appears in
            mathematical form, \emph{e.g.}, $3\kappa^2 + b \sin
            \theta$ would be written
            \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 3 * kappa**2 + b * sin(theta)
\end{verbatim}
            \end{quote}
            
            \begin{reSTadmonition}[Note]
                Functions like \verb+sin()+ can be obtained from the
                \EpydocDottedName{fipy.tools.numerix} module.
                \begin{reSTadmonition}[Warning]
                    Generally, things will not work as expected if the
                    equivalent function is used from the \Numeric{}
                    library.
                \end{reSTadmonition}
            \end{reSTadmonition}
            
            If, however, the source depends on the variable that is being solved for,
            it can be advantageous to linearize the source and cast part of it as an
            implicit source term, \emph{e.g.}, $3\kappa^2 + \phi \sin \theta$
            might be written as
            \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 3 * kappa**2 + ImplicitSourceTerm(coeff = sin(theta))
\end{verbatim}
            \end{quote}
            
            \begin{reSTadmonition}[Warning]
                There are subtleties in properly linearizing a source term
                which are examined in
                Example~\ref{examples:phase:simple:input}.

            \item[How do I represent a \dots{} term that 
            \emph{doesn't} involve the dependent variable?]
            It is important to realize that, even though an expression may
            superficially resemble one of those shown above, if the
            dependent variable \emph{for that PDE} does not appear in the
            appropriate place, then that term should be treated as a source.
            \begin{description}
                \item[How do I represent a diffusive source?]
                    If the governing equation for $\phi$ is
                    \[
                        \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} 
                        = \nabla\cdot\left( D_1 \nabla \phi\right)
                        + \nabla\cdot\left( D_2 \nabla \xi\right)
                    \]
                    then the first term is a \Class{TransientTerm} and the second term 
                    is an \Class{ImplicitDiffusionTerm}, but the third term is 
                    simply an explicit source, which is written in Python as
                    \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> (D2 * xi.getFaceGrad()).getDivergence()
\end{verbatim}
                    \end{quote}
                    Higher order diffusive sources can be obtained by
                    simply nesting the calls to \verb+getFaceGrad()+
                    and \verb+getDivergence()+.
                    \begin{reSTadmonition}[Note]
                        We use \verb|getFaceGrad()|, rather than
                        \verb|getGrad()|, in order to obtain a
                        second-order diffusion term in $\xi$, consistent
                        with the matrix that is formed by
                        \Class{ImplicitDiffusionTerm} for $\phi$.

                    The convection of an independent field $\xi$ as in
                    \[
                        \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} 
                        = \nabla\cdot
                        \left(
                            \vec{u} \xi
                        \right)
                    \]
                    can be rendered as
                    \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> (u * xi.getArithmeticFaceValue()).getDivergence()
\end{verbatim}
                    \end{quote}

                \item[How do I represent a transient source?]
                    The time-rate-of change of an independent variable
                    $\xi$, such as in
                    \[
                        \frac{\partial (\rho_1 \phi)}{\partial t}
                        = \frac{\partial (\rho_2 \xi)}{\partial t}
                    \]
                    does not have an abstract form in \FiPy{} and
                    should be discretized directly, in the manner of
                    Equation~\eqref{eqn:num:tra}, as
                    \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> TransientTerm(coeff = rho1) == rho2 * (xi - xi.getOld()) / timeStep
\end{verbatim}
                    \end{quote}
                    This technique is used in
                    Example~\ref{examples:phase:anisotropy:input}.
                    
            \end{description}

            \item[What if my term involves the dependent variable, 
            but not where \FiPy{} puts it?]
            
            Frequently, viewing the term from a different perspective
            will allow it to be cast in one of the canonical forms.
            For example, the third term in
            \[
                \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} 
                = \nabla\cdot\left( D_1 \nabla \phi\right)
                + \nabla\cdot\left( D_2 \phi \nabla \xi\right)
            \]
            might be considered as the diffusion of the independent
            variable $\xi$ with a mobility $D_2\phi$ that is a
            function of the dependent variable $\phi$.  For \FiPy{}'s
            purposes, however, this term represents the convection of
            $\phi$, with a velocity $D_2\nabla\xi$, due to the
            counter-diffusion of $\xi$, so
            \begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> diffTerm = ImplicitDiffusionTerm(coeff = D1)
>>> convTerm = <Specific>ConvectionTerm(coeff = D2 * xi.getFaceGrad(), 
...                                     diffusionTerm = diffTerm)
>>> eq = TransientTerm() == diffTerm + convTerm
\end{verbatim}

            \end{quote}

        \end{description}
        
    \item[Why the distinction between \Class{CellVariable} and
    \Class{FaceVariable} coefficients?]  \FiPy{} solves field
    variables on the \Class{Cell} centers.  Transient and source terms
    describe the change in the value of a field at the \Class{Cell}
    center, and so they take a \Class{CellVariable} coefficient.
    Diffusion and convection terms involve fluxes \emph{between}
    \Class{Cell} centers, and are calculated on the \Class{Face}
    between two \Class{Cell}s, and so they take a \Class{FaceVariable}
    or \Class{VectorFaceVariable} coefficient.
    
    
    \begin{reSTadmonition}[Note]
        If you supply a \Class{CellVariable} \verb+var+ when a
        \Class{FaceVariable} is expected, \FiPy{} will automatically
        substitute \verb+var.getArithmeticFaceValue()+.  This can have
        undesirable consequences, however. For one thing, the 
        arithmetic face average of a non-linear function is not the 
        same as the same non-linear function of the average argument, 
        \emph{e.g.}, for $f(x) = x^2$,
        \[ f(\frac{1+2}{2}) = \frac{9}{4} \neq 
        \frac{f(1) + f(2)}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
        This distinction is not generally important for smoothly
        varying functions, but can dramatically affect the solution
        when sharp changes are present.  Also, for many problems, such
        as a conserved concentration field that cannot be allowed to
        drop below zero, a harmonic average is more appropriate than
        an arithmetic average.
        
        If you experience problems (unstable or wrong results, or 
        excessively small timesteps), you may need to explicitly supply the 
        desired \Class{FaceVariable} rather than letting \FiPy{} 
        assume one.

    \item[What does this error message mean?]\hspace*{\fill}

            \item ``\texttt{ValueError: frames are not aligned}''
            
            This error most likely means that you have provided a
            \Class{CellVariable} when \FiPy{} was expecting a
            \Class{FaceVariable} (or vice versa).

            convert masked array to Numeric because data is masked in one or

            This not-so-helpful error message could mean a number of things,
            but the most likely explanation is that the solution has become
            unstable and is diverging to $\pm\infty$.  This can be caused by
            taking too large a timestep or by using explicit terms instead of
            implicit ones.

            failures) can result when using the \SciPy{} \weave{} 
            package via the \verb+--inline+ flag. It is due to a bug
            in \SciPy{} that has been patched in their source
