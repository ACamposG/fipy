===========================
Simple Windows Installation
===========================

These instructions are simple step by step instructions for the
`Windows XP`_ and `Windows 2000`_ platforms. Please see the more
general |INSTALLATION-txt| for detailed installation instructions.
These step by step instructions are not the only way to set up |FiPy|
on a Windows OS but represent the most expedient way from our
experience to have a usable installation up and running.

.. note::

   These steps require downloading installation ``.exe`` binary files from
   various web sites.  When given the choice to ``run`` (``open``) or
   ``save`` these files it is best to simply choose ``run`` (``open``).

Step 1: Install Python
----------------------

http://code.enthought.com/enthon/

Download version 1.0.0 and run the installer. Open the
``C:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\vtk_python\`` directory in a browser
and move ``vtkRenderingPythonTkWidgets.dll`` to the ``C:\Python23\``
directory.

Step 2: Install PyVTK
---------------------

http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/PyVTK-0.4.70.win32.exe

Download and run the PyVTK installer.

Step 3: Install Pysparse
------------------------

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pysparse/pysparse-0.34.032.win32-py2.3.exe?download

Download and run the Pysparse installer.

Step 4: Install |FiPy|
----------------------

http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/FiPy-1.1.win32.tar.gz

Download and unpack the tarball. Run the |FiPy| installer
``FiPy-1.1.win32.exe``, which should be in the base FiPy-1.1
directory.

Step 5: Install Gmsh
--------------------

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/bin/Windows/gmsh-1.65.0-Windows.zip

Download and unpack Gmsh for Windows. Open the unpacked folder with a
browser and copy the ``gmsh.exe`` file to ``C:\Python23``.

Step 6: Run IDLE_
-----------------

The IDLE_ environment is recommended for running |FiPy|. In order to
have interactive viewing capabilities the ``-n`` option is
required. To run IDLE_ with the ``-n`` option follow the following
instructions:

   - Click on ``Start``
   - Click on ``Programs``
   - Click on ``Python 2.3 (Enthought Edition)``
   - Right click on ``IDLE (Python GUI)`` and click on ``Create Shortcut`` which creates ``IDLE (Python GUI)(2)``
   - Right click on ``IDLE (Python GUI)(2)``
   - Click on properties
   - Add the ``-n`` option to ``Target`` being sure to leave a space after the last quote and before ``-n``
   - Drag and drop ``IDLE (Python GUI)(2)`` to the desktop to create an icon.

Step 7: Import a module and view the results
--------------------------------------------

You can use the IDLE_ file browser to open the examples and run the
module.

    - Click on ``File``
    - Click on ``Open``
    - Open ``C:\Path\To\Base\FiPy\directory\examples\diffusion\steadyState\mesh50x50\input.py``

This will open an editor, press the F5 key to run the example.
A Matplotlib viewer should appear with rainbow stripes.

Another way to use |FiPy| examples is to import the example file and
then run any functionality it may have. For example at the IDLE_
command line run the following code:

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.append('C://Path//To//Base//FiPy//Directory')
    >>> from examples.levelSet.electroChem.inputGold import runGold
    >>> runGold(numberOfSteps = 100)

A MayaVi viewer should appear with a trench filling simulation.
