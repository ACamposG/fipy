Release Goals 1.1
-----------------

- Dimensions are semi-broken, e.g., 
  examples/elphf/diffusion/input1Ddimensional.py
  Also, numerix inverse trig operations should return an angular
  quantity, rather than a raw number.

    - vaults of parnassus
    - cfd online
    - scipy links
   
- Refactoring:

  * Reduce memory requirements

    - Automated tests.
    - Identify memory usage.

  * Reduce run time

    - Augment automated tests
    - Identify time-consuming code
    - Choose external references 

      * Ryo's code
      * Spectral MATLAB CH problem
      * FemLab
      * DiffPack
      * FemLego?

Long term Goals
---------------

- Documentation:

  * Examples:
  
    - 1000*1000 example for efficiency discussion.

- Distribution

  * freeze or py2exe for CEAC stand-alone

    - viewer? GPL or GLL for gnuplot?

- Functionality:

  * Multigrid method.
  * Cell centered FVM.
  * Multilevel preconditioners
  * Adaptive meshing.
  * Linear Algebra:

    - Petc.
    - SciPy.
    - matpy
	
  * Look into pyrex as an alternative to inlining.
  * Laminar Fluid Flow module.
  * DX viewer.
  * Pass ``PhysicalField`` back to `Konrad Hinsen`_.
  * Found group of solvers from sandia called Trilionos
    http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos
  * As a stop gap measure for 4th and 6th order terms, 
    find an implementation of incomplete cholesky factorization.

- Refactoring:

  * Use an array module rather than Numeric and switch to numarray.

  * Global approach to phase field equations.

  * Make the ``build_docs`` just update the files that have changed since
    the last build.
    
  * Merge ``term`` and ``equation`` objects into one object:

    - Boundary conditions should just be terms.
    
  * Reconcile variable operators and terms

    - Equations should be stated in terms of variable operators.
    - For example a DiffusionTerm is represented by var.getGrad().getDiv()
    - getGrad() and getDiv() should calculate matrices and then use the matrices
      either as part of the solution scheme or explicitly if one just requires the value.
    - The convection term would have a special operator
    - One problem is that terms are really volume integrals while operators
      are just differences. Thus all operators would be volume integrals
      and then divide through be the volume when asked by getValue()
    - The first step would be to make operators use the terms to evaluate themselves.
      i.e.::

          DivGradVariable(CellVariable):
              def __init__(self, var)
                  self.var = var
                  self.matrix =  ImplicitDiffusionTerm.getMatrix()

              def getMatrix(self, ...):
                  return self.matrix
             
              def getValue(self)
                  return ImplicitDiffusionTerm.getMatrix() * self.var.getValue() / self.mesh.getCellVolumes()

     - Next step would be to move the terms to the operator variables.
     - We are now moving terms into variables and that may have hidden benefits.
     - This philosophy should apply to all terms including transient terms.
     - Basicly terms are being abandoned in favor of variable objects.   

  * Use ``doctest`` exclusively.

  * Major mesh refactor:

    - Remove separate ``nummesh`` and ``pymesh`` structure
    - Think about the ``mesh`` hierarchy as it stands:

      * Many branches at present.
      * Consolidate functionality (``__add__`` etc).
      * How does Gmsh fit in?

    - Lazy mesh array evaluations.
    - support for meshes in higher spaces.

  * Viewers:

    - Use viewers in scipy that are similar to gist and remove gist (?).

- Documentation:

  * Write a paper on FiPy.
  * Better documentation in Reference.pdf

- Efficiency

  * Automatic inlining
  * Cache mesh calculations
  * Caching/building sparse matrices?
  * NthOrderDiffusionTerm 

    - recursive stencil vs. recursive matrix?
    - special case lower orders?
    - compare/merge n=2 to ImplicitDiffusionTerm

  * Track down general inefficiencies

    - len(get.xxx()) vs. getNumXXX()
    - array conversions

  * SciPy linear algebra vs. PySparse

    - solution efficiency
    - matrix manipulation efficiency
  
  * NumArray vs Numeric

    - encapsulate array class
