============
Installation
============

The :term:`FiPy` finite volume PDE solver relies on several
third-party packages.  It is *best to obtain and install those first*
before attempting to install :term:`FiPy`. This document explains how
to install :term:`FiPy`, not how to use it. See :ref:`USAGE`
for details on how to use :term:`FiPy`.

.. note::
   
   It may be useful to set up a :ref:`ENVIRONMENT` before beginning
   the installation process.

--------------------------
Installing Python Packages
--------------------------

In general, it is best to use the following order of precedence when
installing packages:

 * Use the operating system package manager, if possible.
 * Use the 
   `pip installs python <http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ 
   (:term:`pip`) tool to obtain software from the 
   `Python Package Index <http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ 
   (:term:`PyPI`) repository::

     $ pip install package

   .. warning::

      :term:`pip` takes care of dependencies that are themselves
      :term:`Python` packages. It does not deal with non-:term:`Python`
      dependencies.

 * Download the packages manually, unpack and run::

     $ python setup.py install

   Further information about each ``setup.py`` script is available by
   typing::

     $ python setup.py --help

For more information on custom installs and development with :term:`FiPy`,
read the :ref:`ENVIRONMENT` section of the :ref:`USAGE` document
before beginning the installation process.

Many of the packages listed below have prebuilt installers for
different platforms (particularly for Windows).  These installers can
save considerable time and effort compared to configuring and building
from source, although they frequently comprise somewhat older versions
of the respective code.  Whether building from source or using a
prebuilt installer, please read and follow explicitly any instructions
given in the respective packages' :file:`README` and
:file:`INSTALLATION` files.

--------------
Obtaining FiPy
--------------

:term:`FiPy` is freely available for download via Subversion_ or as a
compressed archive from
<http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download>. Please see
:ref:`documentation:SVN` for instructions on obtaining :term:`FiPy`
with Subversion_.

.. warning::

   Keep in mind that if you choose to download the `compressed
   archive`_ you will then need to preserve your changes when upgrades
   to :term:`FiPy` become available (upgrades via Subversion_ will handle
   this issue automatically).

.. _compressed archive:      http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/

---------------
Installing FiPy
---------------

Details of the `Required Packages`_ and links are given below and in
`platform-specific instructions`_, but for the courageous and the
impatient, :term:`FiPy` can be up and running quickly by simply
installing the following prerequisite packages on your system:

 * Python_

 * NumPy_ 
 
 * At least one of the :ref:`SOLVERS`

 * At least one of the :ref:`VIEWERS` (:term:`FiPy`'s tests will run 
   without a viewer, but you'll want one for any practical work)
 
Other :ref:`OPTIONALPACKAGES` add greatly to :term:`FiPy`'s
capabilities, but are not necessary for an initial installation or to
simply run the test suite.

It is not necessary to formally install :term:`FiPy`, but if you wish
to do so and you are confident that all of the requisite packages have
been installed properly, you can install it by typing::

    $ pip install fipy

or by unpacking the archive and typing::
  
    $ python setup.py install

at the command line in the base :term:`FiPy` directory.
Alternatively, you may choose not to formally install :term:`FiPy` and
to simply work within the base directory instead. In this case or if
you are making a non-standard install (without admin privileges), read
the :ref:`ENVIRONMENT` section of the :ref:`USAGE` document before
beginning the installation process.

.. _REQUIREDPACKAGES:

-----------------
Required Packages
-----------------

.. warning:

    :term:`FiPy` will not run if the following items are not
    installed.

Python
======

http://www.python.org/

:term:`FiPy` is written in the :term:`Python` language and requires a
:term:`Python` installation to run. :term:`Python` comes pre-installed
on many operating systems, which you can check by opening a terminal
and typing ``python``, *e.g.*::

    $ python
    Python 2.3 (#1, Sep 13 2003, 00:49:11) 
    ...
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

If necessary, you can download_ and install it for your platform
<http://www.python.org/download>.

.. note::

   :term:`FiPy` requires at least version 2.4.x of :term:`Python`. See
   :ref:`RunningUnderPython3` for instructions on how to run
   :term:`FiPy` with `Python 3.x`_.

.. _Python 3.x:   http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://docs.python.org/py3k/
.. _download: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.python.org/download/

:term:`Python` along with many of :term:`FiPy`'s required and optional
packages is available with one of the following distributions.

.. _EPD:

Enthought Python Distribution
-----------------------------

http://www.enthought.com/epd

This installer provides a very large number of useful scientific
packages for :term:`Python`, including :term:`NumPy`,
:term:`SciPy`, :term:`Matplotlib`, :term:`Mayavi`, and :term:`IPython`, as 
well as a :term:`Python` interpreter.  Installers
are available for Windows_, `Mac OS X`_ and `RedHat Linux`_.

.. attention::

   :term:`PySparse` and :term:`FiPy` are not presently included in EPD, so you will need
   to separately install them manually.

.. _PYTHONXY:

Python(x,y)
-----------

http://www.pythonxy.com/

Another comprehensive :term:`Python` package installer for scientific
applications, presently only available for Windows_.

NumPy
=====

http://numpy.scipy.org

Obtain and install the :term:`NumPy` package. :term:`FiPy` requires at
least version 1.0 of NumPy_.

.. _OPTIONALPACKAGES:

-----------------
Optional Packages
-----------------

.. note:

    The following packages are not required to run :term:`FiPy`, but they can
    be helpful.

Gmsh
====

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

:term:`Gmsh` allows the creation of irregular meshes.

SciPy
=====

http://www.scipy.org/

:term:`SciPy` provides a large collection of functions and tools that can
be useful for running and analyzing :term:`FiPy` simulations. Significantly
improved performance has been achieved with the judicious use of C language
inlining (see the :ref:`FlagsAndEnvironmentVariables` section for more
details), via the :mod:`scipy.weave` module.

.. note:

    A handful of test cases use functions from the :term:`SciPy`
    library and will throw errors if it is missing.

------------------------------
Platform-Specific Instructions
------------------------------

:term:`FiPy` is `tested regularly`_ on `Mac OS X`_, `Debian Linux`_,
`Ubuntu Linux`_, and `Windows XP`_. We welcome reports of compatibility
with other systems, particularly if any additional steps are necessary to
install (see `Miscellaneous Build Recipes`_ for user contributed
installation tips).

The only elements of :term:`FiPy` that are likely to be
platform-dependent are the :ref:`VIEWERS` but at least one viewer
should work on each platform.  All other aspects should function on
any platform that has a recent :term:`Python` installation.

Ubuntu/Debian Installation
==========================

:term:`FiPy` now has a `.deb` for Ubuntu/Debian systems that can be
downloaded from <http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download>. Simply run::

  $ dpkg -i python-fipy_x.y.z-1_all.deb

to install. The `.deb` includes dependencies for all of the
:ref:`REQUIREDPACKAGES` and :ref:`OPTIONALPACKAGES`.
