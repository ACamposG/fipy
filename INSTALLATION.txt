============
Installation
============

The |FiPy| finite volume PDE solver relies on several third-party packages.
It is *best to obtain and install those first*, before attempting to install
|FiPy|.

|outsideLinks|

.. note::

   Most of the installation steps will involve a variant on the command::

       $ python setup.py ...

   In addition to the specific commands given here, further information
   about each ``setup.py`` script is available by typing::

       $ python setup.py --help

   For each package, please follow any instructions given in its `README` or 
   `INSTALLATION` files.

----------
Privileges
----------

If you do not have administrative privileges on your computer, or if for
any reason you don't want to tamper with your existing Python_
installation, most packages (including |FiPy|) will allow you to install to
an alternate location.  Instead of installing these packages with
``python setup.py install``,
you would use
``python setup.py install --home=<dir>``,
where ``<dir>`` is the desired installation directory (usually "``~``" to
indicate your home directory).  You will then need to append
``<dir>/lib/python`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.  See the
`Alternate Installation`_ section of the Python_ document "`Installing
Python Modules`_" |citeInstallingPythonModules| for more information, such
as circumstances in which you should use ``--prefix`` instead of
``--home``.

Prerequisites
-------------

Operating System
================

|FiPy| has been developed and tested on the following operating
systems, `Mac OS X`_ 10.3 "Panther" & 10.4 "Tiger", `Debian Linux`_
3.1 "Sarge", `Windows XP`_ and `Windows 2000`_.  We welcome reports of
compatibility with other systems, along with any steps necessary to
install. 

.. note::

   Simple instructions for Windows users are in |WINDOWS-INSTALLATION-txt|.

The only elements of |FiPy| that are likely to be platform-dependent
are the viewers, but at least one viewer should work on each platform.
All other aspects should function on any platform that has a recent
Python_ installation.

Many of the packages listed below have prebuilt installers for different
platforms (particularly for Windows).  These installers can save considerable
time and effort compared to configuring and building from source, although
they frequently comprise somewhat older versions of the respective code.
Whether building from source or using a prebuilt installer, please read and
follow explicitly any instructions given in the respective packages'
``README`` and ``INSTALLATION`` files.

Required Packages
=================

.. warning::

   |FiPy| will not run if the following items are not installed.

.. attention::

   On some platforms, it may be possible to satisfy most, if not all,
   of the following prerequisites by installing the "Enthought 
   Edition of Python (Enthon)". We are aware of `Enthon for Windows`_ 
   |citeEnthonWindows| and `Enthon for Mac OS X`_ |citeEnthonMacOSX|.

Python
------

http://www.python.org/


|FiPy| is written in the Python_ language and requires a Python_
installation to run.  Python_ comes pre-installed on many operating
systems, which you can check by opening a terminal and typing
``python``, *e.g.*::

    $ python
    Python 2.3 (#1, Sep 13 2003, 00:49:11) 
    ...
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

If necessary, you can download_ and install it for your platform 
|citePythonDownload|.

.. note::

   |FiPy| requires at least version 2.3 of Python_.

.. _Python:   http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.python.org/
.. _download: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.python.org/download/
.. |citePythonDownload| raw:: latex

   \cite{PythonDownload}

Numeric
-------

http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy

Obtain and install the Numeric_ package. |FiPy| requires at least
version 23.1 of Numeric_. The newer Numarray_ package is not supported
at this time. `Numeric Windows installers`_ are available.

.. note:: 

   Because of a peculiarity_ in the way that Numeric_ is structured, the
   ``--home=<dir>`` installation option described in Privileges_ will not
   work quite as intended.  To correct this problem, add
   ``<dir>/lib/python/Numeric`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment
   variable.

PySparse
--------

http://pysparse.sourceforge.net

|FiPy| requires `Roman Geus`_' PySparse_ package.

You can either `download the PySparse archive`_ or check it out via
anonymous CVS download::

    $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pysparse login

and press enter at the password prompt, then::

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pysparse \
    >     checkout pysparse

From within the ``pysparse`` base directory, follow its included
instructions for building PySparse_ for your platform. `PySparse Windows
installers`_ are available.

.. note::

   Windows users who choose to build from source should pay particular 
   attention to the instructions in the INSTALL file in the base PySparse_
   directory.

.. warning::

   If pysparse is installed in a local directory a further path may
   have to be added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. For
   example, if

       $ python setup.py install --home=/some/directory/some/where

   then both /some/directory/some/where and
   /some/directory/some/where/lib/python are required to be added to
   the PYTHONPATH. e.g.

       $ set PYTHONPATH=/some/directory/some/where:/some/directory/some/where/lib/python

.. _Roman Geus: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://people.web.psi.ch/geus/

Viewers
=======

|FiPy| will work perfectly well without them, but at least one of the
following packages will be required to view the results of |FiPy|
calculations. |FiPy| will select the first viewer that is available
from the list below.  If more than one is installed, specify a viewer
by setting the ``FIPY_VIEWER`` environment variable to either '``gist``',
'``gnuplot``' or '``matplotlib``'.

Matplotlib
----------

http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

Matplotlib_ is a Python_ package that displays publication quality
results. It displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for
structured data. It does not display unstructured 2D data or 3D data.
It works on all common platforms and produces publication quality hard
copies. Version 0.72.1 or higher is required. `Matplotlib
installers for specific platforms`_ are available 
|citeMatplotlibDownload|.

.. _Matplotlib:  http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net
.. _Matplotlib installers for specific platforms: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80706&package_id=82474
.. |citeMatplotlibDownload| raw:: latex

   \cite{MatplotlibDownload}

Gnuplot-py
----------

http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net

Gnuplot.py_ is a Python_ package that interfaces to gnuplot_, the
popular open-source plotting program. It displays both 1D X-Y type
plots and 2D contour plots for structured data but not for
unstructured data or 3D data. It works on all common platforms and
produces hard copies, however, it sometimes breaks on Windows. As a
general remark, the viewing quality using either Pygist_ or
Matplotlib_ is preferable.

.. _Gnuplot:         http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://gnuplot.sorceforge.net/
.. _Gnuplot.py:       http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net

Pygist
------

http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/python/pygist.html

The Pygist_ package can be used to display simulation results. It
displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour plots for both
structured and unstructured data. It does not display 3D
data. Although stated as working on Windows, it does not seem to do a
good job of rendering on this platform. Pygist_ works fine on other
common platforms. 

.. warning:: 

   The facility to produce hard copies in Pygist_ does not work very
   well and may crash the |FiPy| run.

.. attention::

   Pygist_ seems to be unable to make contour plots on x86_64
   architectures running Linux.

.. note::

   If you experience difficulty building the native Pygist_ viewer on `Mac OS
   X`_, you may wish to to build the package with the ``--x11`` option
   described in its documentation.

.. note::

   Pygist_ can have problems finding color pallets, such as "``heat.gp``"
   and "``work.gs``", when installed locally. A fix for this problem is to
   copy the required pallets into the local directory. The color
   pallets are in "``src/gist/g``" of the base Pygist_ installation.

.. warning::

   If Pygist_ is installed in a local directory a further path may
   have to be added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. For
   example, if

       $ python setup.py install --home=/some/directory/some/where

   then both /some/directory/some/where and
   /some/directory/some/where/lib/python/gist are required to be added to
   the PYTHONPATH. e.g.

       $ set PYTHONPATH=/some/directory/some/where:/some/directory/some/where/lib/python/gist

.. _Pygist: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/python/pygist.html

MayaVi
------

http://mayavi.sourceforge.net

The MayaVi_ Data Visualizer is a free, easy to use scientific data
visualizer.  It displays 1D, 2D and 3D data. It is the only |FiPy|
viewer available for 3D data. Other viewers are probably better for 1D
or 2D viewing. The `Enthon for Windows`_ version of python is
recommended for Windows users who wish to use MayaVi_.

.. warning::

   MayaVi_ can only display 3D meshes consisting entirely of
   tetrahedrons or wedge elements. The ordering of vertices for other
   mesh types may not work.

.. note::

   Is is also necessary to install the PyVTK_ package to use the
   |FiPy| MayaVi_ viewers.

.. _MayaVi: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://mayavi.sourceforge.net

Recommended Packages
====================

.. note::

   The following packages are not required to run |FiPy|, but they can be helpful.

SciPy
-----

http://www.scipy.org/

Significantly improved performance has been achieved with the
judicious use of C language inlining, via the weave_ module of the
SciPy_ package. `SciPy installers for specific platforms`_ 
|citeSciPyDownload| are available.

In addition, a handful of test cases use functions from the SciPy_ library.

.. _weave: http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.scipy.org/documentation/weave/

.. |citeSciPyDownload| raw:: latex

   \cite{SciPyDownload}

gmsh
----

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

It is possible to create irregular meshes with this package.

.. note::

   The `Mac OS X`_ distribution of gmsh provides a nice graphical tool, but
   is structured a bit differently than on other platforms.  To access the
   underlying shell tool, create a shell alias called ``gmsh`` that
   corresponds to ``<Gmsh path>/Gmsh.app/Contents/MacOS/Gmsh``.

----------------
Obtaining |FiPy|
----------------

|FiPy| is freely available for download via CVS_ or as a `compressed
archive`_ |citeFiPyDownload|. To obtain |FiPy| via anonymous CVS, issue the following
commands::

    $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fipy login

and press Return at the password prompt, then to download |FiPy| 1.0 
(recommended)::

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fipy \
    >     checkout -r CURRENT fipy

If you prefer, you can download |FiPy| 0.1 with::

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fipy \
    >     checkout -r STABLE fipy

Further information about CVS_ can be found in |documentation:CVS.txt| and
in the `online CVS instructions`_ |citeSourceForgeCVS|.

.. note::

   An expedient way for Windows users who use CVS is to simply get the
   cvs executable and run it from the command prompt. This seems
   somewhat simpler than using the many GUI CVS tools available. The
   one place that seems to actually have a link to cvs.exe is
   http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/winntutil.html#sshnt. The
   actual link to cvs.exe_.

.. warning::

   Keep in mind that if you choose to download the `compressed
   archive`_ you will then need to preserve your changes when upgrades
   to |FiPy| become available (upgrades via CVS_ will handle this
   issue automatically).

.. _cvs.exe: http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/ftp/pub/winnt/util/cvs.exe
.. _compressed archive:      http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/

Manual
======

You can `download the latest manual`_ |citeFiPyGuide|. Alternatively, it may be 
possible to build a fresh copy by issuing the following command in the
base directory::

    $ python setup.py build_docs --latex --manual

.. note::

   This mechanism is intended primarily for the developers.  A
   command-line pdfTeX installation and several |LaTeX| packages are
   required; particularly ``memoir.cls``.  You will also need to add
   ``~/path/to/fipy/utils`` to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment
   variable.

.. _download the latest manual:  http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/download/

.. |citeFiPyGuide| raw:: latex

   \cite{FiPyGuide}

--------------
Testing |FiPy|
--------------

From the base directory, you can verify that |FiPy| works properly by
executing::

    $ python setup.py test

Depending on the packages you chose to install in `Recommended Packages`_,
be sure to set the appropriate environment variables.  You can expect a few
errors if you did not install all of the recommended packages.

If you chose to install the `weave`_ package, you should rerun the
tests with::

    $ python setup.py test --inline

A few tests will fail the first time as a result of the messages
output in the course of caching the compiled inline code, but a repeat
test should have no failures (although see "``repairing catalog by
removing key``" in |the FAQ|).

.. note::

   In order for Python_ to find the |FiPy| modules, you will need to ensure
   that the base directory is added to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment
   variable, *e.g.*::

       $ setenv PYTHONPATH .:${PYTHONPATH}

   or::

       $ export PYTHONPATH=.:${PYTHONPATH}
       
-----------------
Installing |FiPy|
-----------------

It is not necessary to formally install |FiPy|, but if you wish to do so
and you are confident that all of the requisite packages have been
installed properly and |FiPy| passes its tests, you can install it by
typing::

    $ python setup.py install

at the command line.  Alternatively, you may choose not to formally install
|FiPy| and to simply work within the base directory instead.  

If you choose to install, Python_ will find your |FiPy| modules 
automatically. If you choose not to install, then you will need to ensure 
that the |FiPy| distribution directory is appended to your ``PYTHONPATH`` 
environment variable (either "``.``" if you are working within the |FiPy| 
directory, or "``~/path/to/fipy``" if you are working in your own directory).

------------
Using |FiPy|
------------

To see examples of problems that |FiPy| is capable of solving, you can
run any of the scripts in |examples/|. You can type, *e.g.*::

    $ python examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py

at the command line, which should produce a graphical display of the
solution. 

With judicious use of the weave_ package, we have been able to obtain
significantly improved performance for some problems, while keeping the code as clear as
possible.  You can invoke this faster code by passing the ``--inline``
option at the command line, *i.e.*::

    $ python examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py --inline

In order to customize the examples, or to develop your own scripts, some
knowledge of Python syntax is required.  We recommend you familiarize
yourself with the excellent `Python tutorial`_ |citePythonTutorial| 
or with `Dive Into Python`_ |citeDiveIntoPython|.
