A viewer is required to see the results of :term:`FiPy`
calculations. :term:`Matplotlib` is by far the most widely used
:term:`Python` based viewer and the best choice to get :term:`FiPy` up
and running quickly. :term:`Matplotlib` is also capable of publication
quality plots. :term:`Matplotlib` does not have a 3D capability, for
that :term:`Mayavi` is required.

:term:`Matplotlib` is a Python_ package that displays publication
quality results. It displays both 1D X-Y type plots and 2D contour
plots for structured data. It does not display unstructured 2D data or
3D data.  It works on all common platforms and produces publication
quality hard copies. Version 0.72.1 or higher is required. `Matplotlib
installers for specific platforms`_ are available
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80706&package_id=82474>.

The `Mayavi 2`_ Data Visualizer is a free, easy to use scientific data
visualizer.  It displays 1D, 2D and 3D data. It is the only :term:`FiPy`
viewer available for 3D data. Other viewers are probably better for 1D
or 2D viewing. 

.. note::
   
   `Mayavi 2`_ is packaged for Ubuntu and Debian linux. Using the packaged versions makes installation much easier.

.. note::

   MayaVi 1 is no longer supported.
