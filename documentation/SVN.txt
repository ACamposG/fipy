SVN usage

This section describes the use and setup of the |FiPy| Subversion
repository. Users can download various tagged revisions of FiPy
depending on their needs. In general, most users will not want to
download the very latest state of FiPy, as these files are subject to
active development and may not behave as desired. Most users will not
be interested in particular version numbers either, but instead with
the degree of code stability. Different "tracking tags" are used to
indicate different stages of FiPy development.  You will need to
decide on your own risk tolerance when deciding which stage of
development to track. A fresh copy of FiPy that is designated by a
particular ``<tag>`` can be obtained with::

   $ svn checkout http://matdl-osi.org/svn/fipy/<tag>

An existing SVN checkout of FiPy can be shifted to a different state of
development by issuing the command::

   $ svn switch http://matdl-osi.org/svn/fipy/<tag> .

in the base directory of the working copy. The main tags (``<tag>``)
for FiPy, in decreasing order of stability, are:

``tags/STABLE``
    designates the most recent release in the repository that can be
    considered stable for daily use by the common user.  This is a good tag
    to track if you don't want to run into bugs introduced with ongoing
    development but would like to take advantage of new features as soon as
    possible.

``tags/CURRENT``
    designates the most recent code on the trunk forming a coherent state
    of FiPy, in general this will mean a release, but can also mean a
    pre-release testing version.  For instance, the release engineer might
    ask testers to test ``tags/CURRENT`` before he makes a release.

``trunk``
    designates the latest revision of any file present in the
    repository.  FiPy is not guaranteed to pass its tests or to be in a
    consistent state when checked out under this tag.     

``tags/version-x_y``
    designates a released version x.y. Any released
    version of FiPy will be designated with a fixed tag: The current
    version of FiPy is |VERSION|.

``branches/branch-version-x_y``
    designates a line of development based on a previously released version
    (i.e., if current development work is being spent on version 0.2, but a
    bug is found and fixed in version 0.1, that fix will be tagged as
    ``version-0_1_1``, and can be obtained from ``branch-version-0_1``).

Any other tags will not generally be of interest to most users.
