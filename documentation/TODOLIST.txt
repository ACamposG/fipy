Release Goals 1.0
-----------------

- Documentation:

  * Review all for accuracy/consistency.
  * Refer to Roman's pysparse distro.
  * Include some examples on the web page.
  * Include some pictures of simulations in the documentation.
  * Efficiency and --inline discussion.
  * Examples:
  
    - 1000*1000 example for efficiency discussion.

- Distribution

  * Install and test with no write permissions.
  * Windows install.
  * freeze or py2exe for CEAC stand-alone

    - viewer? GPL or GLL for gnuplot?

  * Get FiPy registered on:

    - vaults of parnassus
    - cfd online
    - scipy links
   
- Functionality:

  * Linear Algebra:

    - Iterative solver in place of superLU for non-symmetric matrices
      
  * Viewing variables on an unstructured mesh.

    - gnuplot

  * Gnuplot-py:

    - Viewing of variables for Grid2D objects.
    - Justification:

      * Gnuplot is available on Windows and it is standard on unix and linux platforms.
      * Gnuplot-py is easy to install and is well supported.
      * Gnuplot version 4.0 looks good for contour plots.
      * Much faster than PyX. PyX is very slow for plotting large contour plots.
      * The gist hardcopy functionality is mangled.

  * Pass ``PhysicalField`` back to `Konrad Hinsen`_.

  * Better ``__repr__`` for FiPy objects.

  * Create Grid1D as trivial decendant of Grid2D.

- Refactoring:

  * Viewers:

    - Create base viewing class.
    - Use viewers in scipy that are similar to gist and remove gist (?).
    - Refactor PyX viewer.

  * Reduce memory requirements

    - Automated tests.
    - Identify memory usage.

  * Reduce run time

    - Augment automated tests
    - Identify time-consuming code
    - Choose external references 

      * Ryo's code
      * Spectral MATLAB CH problem
      * FemLab
      * DiffPack
      * FebLego?

- Efficiency

  * Cache mesh calculations

Long term Goals
---------------

- Functionality:

  * Multigrid method.
  * Cell centered FVM.
  * Adaptive meshing.
  * Linear Algebra:

    - Petc.
    - SciPy.
    - matpy
	
  * Look into pyrex as an alternative to inlining.
  * Laminar Fluid Flow module.
  * DX viewer.

- Refactoring:

  * Use an array module rather than Numeric and switch to numarray.

  * Global approach to phase field equations.

  * Make the ``build_docs`` just update the files that have changed since
    the last build.
    
  * Merge ``term`` and ``equation`` objects into one object:

    - Boundary conditions should just be terms.
   
  * Use ``doctest`` exclusively.

  * Major mesh refactor:

    - Remove separate ``nummesh`` and ``pymesh`` structure
    - Think about the ``mesh`` hierarchy as it stands:

      * Many branches at present.
      * Consolidate functionality (``__add__`` etc).
      * How does Gmsh fit in?

    - Lazy mesh array evaluations.

- Documentation:

  * Write a paper on FiPy.
  * Better documentation in Reference.pdf

- Efficiency

  * Automatic inlining
  * Caching/building sparse matrices?
  * NthOrderDiffusionTerm 

    - recursive stencil vs. recursive matrix?
    - special case lower orders?
    - compare/merge n=2 to ImplicitDiffusionTerm

  * Track down general inefficiencies

    - len(get.xxx()) vs. getNumXXX()
    - array conversions

  * SciPy linear algebra vs. PySparse

    - solution efficiency
    - matrix manipulation efficiency
  
  * NumArray vs Numeric

    - encapsulate array class
